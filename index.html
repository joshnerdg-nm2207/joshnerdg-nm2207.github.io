        Religion and sports have a long-standing relationship, with athletes often expressing their faith through post-victory interviews and religious gestures during competition. <em>From kneeling down to pray to pointing to the sky</em>, these actions have sparked countless debates on the role of religion in sports. Despite the controversies, the utility of faith within sports has been the subject of numerous articles, columns, books, and documentaries.

      <h3 class="text-h3"><strong>Religiousness and Perceived God Perfectionism Among Elite Athletes</strong>
      </h3>  
      <br>
      <p class="text-body-2">
        Scholars from various fields have analysed and synthesised the integration of religion and sports historically and presently. However, research on the impact of religious practices and experiences on athletes' emotional health and performance in sports is <b>limited</b>. The little research that exists has yielded mixed results, and further investigation is necessary due to the established link between <b>religiousness</b> and <b>psychological well-being</b> in other fields of psychology.
        <br><br>
        The study focuses on the <b>correlation</b> between religiousness, perceptions of God perfectionism, and how elite athletes cope with disappointing performance and upcoming competitions. Researchers analysed the cognitive appraisals of athletes and their reactions towards God during low performance, and linked these findings to the athletes' global self worth and perfectionistic concerns.
        <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-h3">
        <strong>The study aims to provide a better understanding of the relationship between religious beliefs and athletic performance under pressure.</strong>
