      <p class="text-body-1">
        Muhammad Ali, also known as Cassius Clay, was not just a legendary boxer but a cultural icon, a civil rights activist, and a beacon of hope for millions around the world. His flashy personality, quick wit, and unparalleled athleticism made him a captivating figure both inside and outside the ring. Born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali grew up in a segregated America, where racial discrimination was rampant. Despite facing numerous obstacles, he defied the odds to become one of the greatest boxers of all time, winning three championships and numerous other accolades.

      <h3 class="text-h3" style=color:goldenrod><strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>
      </h3>  
      <br>
      <p class="text-body-2">
        Ali's faith in Islam was a defining aspect of his life and career. In 1964, he announced that he had converted to the Nation of Islam, a controversial black nationalist movement that advocated for racial separation and empowerment. He changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, declaring that his former "slave name" was a symbol of the oppression and injustice he had endured as a black man in America. His conversion to Islam brought him closer to his African roots and gave him a sense of pride and purpose that he had never felt before.

        <br>
        <p class="text-body-2">
          However, Ali's religious beliefs also cost him dearly in his sporting career. In 1967, he refused to be drafted into the US Army to fight in the Vietnam War, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war. This decision cost him his boxing licence and prevented him from defending his title for nearly four years. He was also stripped of his championship title and faced widespread criticism and condemnation from the media and the public. However, Ali remained steadfast in his convictions and continued to speak out against injustice and inequality, even at great personal cost.

        <em>"Boxing is just a game, a stepping-stone to something greater: my purpose is to bring attention to the plight of my people" - Ali, 1975</em>
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-body-2">
          Ali's faith in Islam played a crucial role in his boxing career. His religious beliefs gave him a strong sense of discipline and determination which he channelled into his fights. He saw boxing not just as a sport, but as a means to inspire and uplift his people, and to prove that African Americans could excel in any field. His faith also helped him to stay grounded in the face of success, and to maintain a sense of perspective and purpose beyond the ring. These qualities, combined with his talent and charisma, made him an unstoppable force in the boxing world and a role model for millions around the globe.

            Religion and sports have a long-standing relationship, with athletes often expressing their faith through post-victory interviews and religious gestures during competition. <em>From kneeling down to pray to pointing to the sky</em>, these actions have sparked countless debates on the role of religion in sports. Despite the controversies, the utility of faith within sports has been the subject of numerous articles, columns, books, and documentaries.

					<p>
						 Scholars from various fields have analysed and synthesised the integration of religion and sports historically and presently. 
						 <br><br>
						 However, research on the impact of religious practices and experiences on athletes' emotional health and performance in sports is limited. 
						 <br><br>
						 The little research that exists has yielded mixed results, and further investigation is necessary due to the established link between religiousness and psychological well-being in other fields of psychology.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>
						The study focuses on the <b>correlation</b> between religiousness, perceptions of God perfectionism, and how elite athletes cope with <b>disappointing performance</b> and <b>upcoming competitions</b>. <br><br>
						Researchers analysed the cognitive appraisals of athletes and their reactions towards God during low performance, and linked these findings to the athletes' <b>global self worth</b> and <b>perfectionistic concerns</b>.
					</p>
					<p><b>Keywords: Religion, God Perfectionism, Self-Views, Elite Athlete, and Coping Strategies</b></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<p>Premise 1<br>
						<b>The Promise of Religiousness: Promotion of Global Self Worth</b>
						<br><br>
						Definitions: 
						<br>
						<b>Religion</b> is defined as a system of beliefs and practices observed by a community, supported by rituals that acknowledge the Sacred, Divine, God or Ultimate Truth. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Religiousness</b> is measured by engagement in both public and private religious activities, as well as personal religious commitment and motivation.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="4">
					<p>Premise 1<br>
						<b>The Promise of Religiousness: Promotion of Global Self Worth</b>
						<br><br>
						Elaboration:
						<br>
						Religious beliefs can benefit athletes by promoting self-worth and improving emotional well-being, allowing them to better cope with challenges. In elite sports, where self-worth is often tied to performance, religious beliefs provide a more stable and consistent source of self-worth based on faith, which is important in a culture with unhealthy self-views.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="5">
					<p>Premise 2<br>
						<b>The Pitfall of Religion: Views of God as Perfectionistic</b>
						<br><br>
						Definition:
						<br>
						<b>God perfectionism</b> refers to the belief among some religious athletes that their performance is tied to God's love or affection. This can create pressure to achieve perfect performance in order to prove their worth and stay in God's favour. It is characterised by a view of God as highly perfectionistic.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="6">
					<p>Premise 2<br>
						<b>The Pitfall of Religion: Views of God as Perfectionistic</b>
						<br><br>
						Elaboration:
						<br>
						Perfectionism can have <b>adaptive</b> and <b>maladaptive</b> aspects. Setting high standards can be beneficial, but if they are unattainable, it can lead to negative outcomes. Beliefs about God's perfectionism can also affect personal perfectionism. For elite athletes, a high discrepancy between God's standards and their own performance can lead to negative outcomes, including perfectionistic concern.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="7">
					<p>Premise 3<br>
						<b>How Views of God Affect Appraisals of Performance: Looking to the Past and Future</b>
						<br><br>
						Although religiousness and views of God’s perfectionism are conceptualised as stable dispositions, the ways they are expressed and affect the emotional health outcomes of athletes may differ depending on the relevant situation. Two types of <b>psychological situations</b> that are highly salient for appraisals of self-worth and perfectionism are dealing with:
						<br><br>
						1.<b> Disappointing Performances</b> 
						<br><br>
						2.<b> Anticipating an upcoming competition</b>
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="8">
					<p><b>Disappointing performances</b>
						<br><br>
						Athletes dealing with disappointing performances can either internalise failure as a reflection of their worth or use it as an opportunity for growth. <b>Shame</b> can arise from this failure and lead to negative emotions. 
						<br><br>
						Turning towards God can lead to better psychological adjustment and comfort where higher levels of intrinsic religiousness are linked to more positive religious and spiritual coping. 
						</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="9">
					<p><b>Anticipating an upcoming competition</b>
						<br><br>
						Athletes in high-pressure situations can experience stress related to cognitive appraisals, such as viewing competition as a <b>threat</b> or a <b>challenge</b>. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Challenge appraisals</b> are linked to positive coping skills and performance satisfaction, while <b>threat appraisals</b> are linked to negative emotions and maladaptive coping.
						<br><br> 
						</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="10">
					<p>Study:
						<br><br>
						<b>Physiological Situation:</b> Disappointing performances
						<br><br>
						<b>Hypothesis 1:</b> Athlete religiousness and perceptions of God’s perfectionism will be directly related to athletes’ attitudes towards God (both comfort from & anger towards) and feelings of shame after recalling a failed sporting performance.
						<br><br>
						<b>Hypothesis 2:</b> Religiousness and God perfectionism will be indirectly related to shame through self-worth and perfectionistic concern.
					</p>						
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="11">
					<p>Study:
						<br><br>
						<b>Physiological Situation:</b> Anticipating an upcoming competition
						<br><br>
						<b>Hypothesis 3:</b> Religiousness and God perfectionism will only be related to cognitive stress appraisals (challenge, stress, threat) of an upcoming competition through their relationship with self-worth and perfectionistic concerns.
					</p>						
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="12">
					<p>
						<b>Study Participant Characteristics</b>
						<br><br>
						1. Gender
						<br>
						2. Ethnicity
						<br>
						3. Belief in God
						<br>
						4. Religion
						<br>
						5. Career Stage
						<br>
						6. Type of sport
						<br>
						7. Level of competition
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="13">
					<p><b>Strategic Analysis</b>
						<br><br>
						The study used <b>descriptive statistics</b> and <b>bivariate correlations</b> to analyse the variables. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was then conducted to test two separate physiological situations.
						<br><br>
						Both models included a latent factor for religiousness with three indicators, as well as observed variables of global self-worth and perfectionistic concern. 
						<br><br>
						<span style="font-size: smaller;">Legend: NORA = Non-organisational religious activity; ORA = Organisational religious activity; IR = Intrinsic Religiousness; GPS = God perfectionism standards; GPD = God perfectionism discrepancy; RSES = Global self-worth; PERF = Perfectionism Concern; COM = Feelings of comfort from God; CA = Challenge appraisal; SA = Stress appraisal; TA = Threat appraisal</span>
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="step" data-step="14">
					<p>Results:
						<br>
						<b>Disappointing performances</b>
						<br><br>
						An athlete's level of religiousness and perfectionistic views of God (discrepancy and standards) were <b>directly related</b> to their attitude towards God after experiencing a disappointing performance in different ways.
						<br><br>
						Specifically, religiousness was <b>related</b> to feelings of comfort from God, whereas <b>high levels</b> of both standards and discrepancy were <b>related</b> to <b>higher levels</b> of anger towards God.
						<br><br>
						Religiousness and discrepancy were also <b>indirectly related</b> to shame through self-worth and perfectionistic concerns.
						<br><br>
						Perceived God standards were <b>not related</b> to self-worth, perfectionistic concern, or shame.						
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="15">
					<p>Results:
						<br>
						<b>Anticipating an upcoming competition</b>
						<br><br>
						Religiousness and perceived God discrepancy were <b>indirectly related</b> to appraisals of upcoming competition but in different ways. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Higher levels</b> of reported religiousness were <b>related</b> to viewing an upcoming competition as a challenge and <b>negatively related</b> to both threat and stress appraisals. 
						<br><br>
						Meanwhile, perceived God discrepancy was <b>linked</b> to challenge appraisals via a <b>negative relation</b> with self-worth.
						<br><br>
						Additionally, perceived God perfectionism discrepancy was <b>indirectly related</b> to both threat and stress appraisals of upcoming competitions through a <b>positive relation</b> to perfectionistic concerns.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="16">
					<p><b>Findings:</b>
						<br>
						The study found that athletes' religiousness and perceived discrepancy from God were related to their post-disappointment shame and appraisals of upcoming competition through their impact on global self-worth and perfectionistic concerns. 
						<br><br>
						Religiousness was linked to higher levels of self-worth and comfort from God, whereas perceived discrepancy from God was linked to lower levels of self-worth and higher levels of anger towards God.
						<br><br>
						Additionally, religiousness was related to viewing competition as a challenge through a positive relationship with global self-worth. The results were consistent even when years of competition were taken into account, and no further analyses were conducted due to power constraints.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="17">
					<p>Conclusion: 
						<br>
						<strong>The study underscores the importance of addressing the religious and spiritual needs of elite athletes in their mental preparation for performance.</strong>
						<br><br>
						Practitioners may require cultural competence in understanding the impact of religiosity/spirituality on coping. 
						<br><br>
						Engaging in conversations about athletes' religious faith can strengthen rapport and understanding.
						<br><br>
						It is crucial to challenge the view of performance-based self-worth and help athletes find value in their religious beliefs.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Highlighting the emotional and spiritual disruption caused by perfectionistic views of God and emphasizes the need for healthy religious identity formation among athletes.</strong>
