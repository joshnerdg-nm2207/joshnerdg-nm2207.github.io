        Muhammad Ali, also known as Cassius Clay, was not just a legendary boxer but a cultural icon, a civil rights activist, and a beacon of hope for millions around the world. His flashy personality, quick wit, and unparalleled athleticism made him a captivating figure both inside and outside the ring. Born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali grew up in a segregated America, where racial discrimination was rampant. Despite facing numerous obstacles, he defied the odds to become one of the greatest boxers of all time, winning three championships and numerous other accolades.

      <p class="text-body-2">
        Ali's faith in Islam was a defining aspect of his life and career. In 1964, he announced that he had converted to the Nation of Islam, a controversial black nationalist movement that advocated for racial separation and empowerment. He changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, declaring that his former "slave name" was a symbol of the oppression and injustice he had endured as a black man in America. His conversion to Islam brought him closer to his African roots and gave him a sense of pride and purpose that he had never felt before.

        <p class="text-body-2">
          However, Ali's religious beliefs also cost him dearly in his sporting career. In 1967, he refused to be drafted into the US Army to fight in the Vietnam War, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war. This decision cost him his boxing licence and prevented him from defending his title for nearly four years. He was also stripped of his championship title and faced widespread criticism and condemnation from the media and the public. However, Ali remained steadfast in his convictions and continued to speak out against injustice and inequality, even at great personal cost.

        </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-body-2">
          Ali's faith in Islam played a crucial role in his boxing career. His religious beliefs gave him a strong sense of discipline and determination which he channelled into his fights. He saw boxing not just as a sport, but as a means to inspire and uplift his people, and to prove that African Americans could excel in any field. His faith also helped him to stay grounded in the face of success, and to maintain a sense of perspective and purpose beyond the ring. These qualities, combined with his talent and charisma, made him an unstoppable force in the boxing world and a role model for millions around the globe.

            Religion and sports have a long-standing relationship, with athletes often expressing their faith through post-victory interviews and religious gestures during competition. <em>From kneeling down to pray to pointing to the sky</em>, these actions have sparked countless debates on the role of religion in sports. Despite the controversies, the utility of faith within sports has been the subject of numerous articles, columns, books, and documentaries.

					<p>Background:
          <br><br>
          Scholars from various fields have analysed and synthesised the integration of religion and sports historically and presently. However, research on the impact of religious practices and experiences on athletes' emotional health and performance in sports is <b>limited</b>. The little research that exists has yielded mixed results, and further investigation is necessary due to the established link between <b>religiousness</b> and <b>psychological well-being</b> in other fields of psychology.
          </p>

				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>Introduction:
            <br><br>
            The study focuses on the <b>correlation</b> between religiousness, perceptions of God perfectionism, and how elite athletes cope with disappointing performance and upcoming competitions. Researchers analysed the cognitive appraisals of athletes and their reactions towards God during low performance, and linked these findings to the athletes' global self worth and perfectionistic concerns.

						Still working on making the charts (sizing and visibility), developing how to portray the study concisely (maybe just focusing on a particular result) and being able to transition from slide to slide while scrolling. (PS I couldn't get the transitions in Js to work so have to manually click for now - Charts in Slide 5 to 7)</p>
